    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an exploration of orbital debris modeling and an introduction to ODAP (Orbital Debris Analysis with Python). While ODAP is currently being refined and converted into a standalone module, you will be able to explore how the module functions and can be utilized in research throughout this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this project started from a personal curiosity about how orbital debris works, but later was the basis for a senior thesis written while attending the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. The purpose is to develop a modern open-source python implementation of the NASA Standard Breakup Model that others can use to research orbital debris.\n",

    "Since this project is on going, please note that some functionality may not be working as expected as I continue to go through the process of optimizing and validating the implementations of the various components."

    "The NASA standard breakup model uses experimental observations performed both on Earth and in orbit to characterize the breakup using statistical distributions. The choice to use statistical distributions is a result of the stochastic nature of the breakup event, meaning it would be impossible to reproduce the same circumstances each time. By using a statistical distribution and sampling from it we can more accurately represent the fragments that would be generated during a collision or explosion.\n",

    "To account for the different characteristics of each fragment of debris, the statistical distributions must be expressed as a function of some independent variable. In the latest version of the NASA breakup model, this variable is called the characteristic length, denoted $L_c$. By defining the distributions using characteristic length we ensure that the mass, area, and velocity of each fragment are not constant for all debris with the same characteristic length. The implementation of the characteristic length distribution can be cumbersome to follow. As such, a flow chart illustrating the steps of the algorithm is provided below.\n",

    "### Area to Mass Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The area-to-mass ratio, A/M , for fragments is a distribution that was based on analysis of thousands of fragmentation debris and provides us with a method to determine the mass of each fragment of debris. The discrete distributions were found by using a $\\chi^2$ fit to orbital decay characteristics for 1,780 upper stage explosion fragments, and similar data was developed for spacecraft fragments. Each type of debris producer - rocket bodies (RB), spacecraft (SC), satellites (SAT) - will produce different size debris. As such, the distribution that determines the area to mass ratio has three variants. All three are based on a normal distribution but use different expressions for determining the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, small objects with $L_c < 8$cm, SAT, the $A/M$ distribution is expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\tD_{A/M}(\\lambda_c, \\chi) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{A/M}(\\lambda_c), \\sigma_{A/M}(\\lambda_c), \\chi).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{A/M}$ is the distribution function of $\\chi$ as a function of $\\lambda_c$, where\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\t\\lambda_c &= \\log_{10}(L_c),\\\\\n",
    "\t\\chi &= \\log_{10}(A/M)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{N}$ is the normal distribution function with mean $\\mu_{A/M}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{A/M}$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\t \\mu_{A/M} &= \\begin{cases} \n",
    "\t\t-0.3, & \\lambda_c\\leq -1.75 \\\\\n",
    "\t\t-0.3 - 1.4(\\lambda_c + 1.75), & -1.75 < \\lambda_c <-1.25 \\\\\n",

    "Every fragment of debris has a corresponding $A/M$ distribution since both $\\mu_{A/M}$ and $\\sigma_{A/M}$ are functions of $\\lambda_c$. To determine the corresponding $A/M$ ratio for each debris, a random value is drawn from the distribution. This accounts for stochastic nature of breakup events mentioned previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The $A/M$ ratio alone does not provide enough information to determine both the area and mass of a fragment. As such, the average cross-sectional area, $A$, can also be obtained through a one-to-one correspondence with $L_c$ using the following expression:\n",

    "$M = A_x / (A/M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change in Velocity Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential amount of velocity that each fragment will gain due to the breakup event is determined in a similar manner to the $A/M$ ratio. The notable differences are that the distribution is now a log-normal distribution and that an additional check is implemented to ensure that extremely high ejection velocities are not included in the case of collisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, the velocity check is performed by sampling a value from the velocity distribution and checking if it is lower than $1.3v_c$, where $v_c$ is the relative collision velocity. If the value fails the check then new values are drawn until the check is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change in velocity, $\\Delta v$, is modeled by log-normal distribution that is function of the $A/M$ ratio by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "where for SAT breakups \\begin{align}\n",
    "\t&\\xi = \\log_{10}(\\Delta v),\\\\\n",
    "\t&\\chi = \\log_{10}(A/M),\\\\\n",
    "\t&\\mu_{v}(\\chi) = 0.2\\chi+1.85,\\\\\n",
