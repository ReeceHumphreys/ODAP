## Introduction

Orbital Debris Analysis with Python (ODAP) is an in-progress python package that implements the NASA Standard Breakup Model for simulating fragmentation events. It also includes tools for further orbital debris analysis, such as an orbit propagator that includes perturbations and various visualization tools.

## Overhaul Progress

#### ODAP is currently undergoing a major overhaul to convert it into an open python package as such, functionality is influx and some features may be broken. Below shows the current progress torward this overhaul.

- [x] Refactor NASA Breakup model implementation
- [ ] Overhaul Jupyter notebook
- [ ] Implement API docs
- [ ] Add Testing + full code coverage
- [ ] Refactor orbit propagator
- [ ] Refactor visualization tools
- [ ] Implement addtional analysis tools

## Setup Environment

TODO: Update install instructions to use Poetry and Pyenv
